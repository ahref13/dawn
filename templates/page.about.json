It’s a destination for women who don’t relate to the mainstream bridal offering and want a relaxed yet elevated alternative to wedding dress shopping.\n\nOur designers are all carefully selected not only for their quality and style, but also their ethos and values. Each of our designers makes locally with an ethical production approach and almost exclusively female teams.\n\nWe offer a considered space and experience where we will guide and support you throughout the process, making sure you feel comfortable and beautiful on your wedding day. ",
